Researching machine learning algorithms for source separation and network compression for efficient inference
systems. Delved into recurrent neural networks (RNN) with gated recurrent units for speech denoising and
audio enhancement, and quantized into bitwise system for efficiency. Currently exploring attention models on
RNNs and winner-take-all hashing implementation of non-negative matrix factorization for source separation.

The Bitwise Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) network aims to perform the source separation task with
minimal computational cost. RNNs are hard to train and heavy in space and time complexity. The BGRU
model quantizes the feedforward procedure with binarized values and bitwise operations. The network is
initialized with pretrained real-valued weights and incrementally binarized to preserve the quality of the
source separation system. Experiments show that the BGRU model can outperform a real-valued fully
connected network with fewer number of weights.
